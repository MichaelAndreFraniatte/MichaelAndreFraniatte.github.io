                        <p>
                            The guide is made to understand better how to set control for better competitive
                            gameplay. The example taken here is Call of Duty because it's a good one with 
                            complete parameters in game options but setting adapted control is important,
                            particularly when using a motion controller, such even a multi-billions society
                            making games since several decades can not understand entirely what they doing. 
                            It's a complete guide to know how setting control like button or key binding or
                            mapping, like deadzones, sensitivity, aiming curves, etc. It's like a tutorial to
                            follow steps after steps to have the best control in Call of Duty using controller
                            like Wiimote and Nunchuck, nobody never have handle well like it's done here. It can 
                            be extend for all games, even not competitive, or without multiplayer, having only
                            a campaign mode. You can't break anything. You just need to take care of what you 
                            doing, and remenber your settings. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            It's better to keep the same schema on your controller for binding and mapping
                            button or key to remember naturally what you need to play confortable and
                            also when the games are indicating the button or key to press. Enable toggle
                            aiming, enable toggle crouch, enable maintain for grenades. It's more easy to
                            know which button or key to press when you have QTH in games just seeing the 
                            game key or button schema indicators, and knowing where you always bind or map your buttons or keys, 
                            because it's often same action from games to games, and so you can have always
                            same settings for your control. You can check input delay to know what is more
                            responsive. Native device handle by games is always with less latency, when 
                            it's well handle of course, if several type of devices are handle. If you like 
                            games, you can only like what is handle natively, and you find your pleasure.
                            You can completly disguard the meaning of using a custom control, and multiplayer
                            games often too much trash, and not enjoyable finally.

                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <h3 class="w3-center colored"><b>Deadzone and Sensitivity</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            Set deadzones from 0 to 99 for sticks and 0 for triggers. Set a linear curves for 
                            aiming in game options and remove deadzones by yourself for sticks and also enable
                            a cubic curves while setting a sensitivity for half turning while jumping with a normal jump. The cubic
                            curves you set on axis X and Y for aiming shall be the same and adapted to your enjoy.
                            When you play top down shooters, you can use cursor and remove window title or topmost,
                            for having a true pointer. Like for FPS games, for top down shooters, you can use desktop 
                            cursor and change sensitivity. Maybe it can ask to always set window position and size, because moving
                            cursor and clicking on window can move it or resize it. When you remove deadzones too much,
                            it move like crazy, and when you don't remove deadzones enough, the deadzone is bigger. Concerning
                            remote play, you can have a very good control for aiming, when you set well your firewalls,
                            your network, and switching to the console screen, instead of your PC screen. Don't choose
                            cloud gaming, but local remote play instead, be near from your network and hardwares, and use the good one
                            dedicated application, like official one. Setting network security, like a DNS server is also
                            important, for fluidic control. Less useless network packets you have, but letting good packets, with a 
                            good speed rate of internet, make the control for aiming better. You don't see latency of control,
                            as for the audio, like this. Actually, with a custom controller, you can enjoy playing on console a lot. 
                            Often, particularly for old games on consoles, you don't have same sensitivity while aiming than not
                            aiming, and it's not competitive at all. There's often a kind of latency implemented in games, when you 
                            toggle aiming or turning to maximum. It's important to have good settings in game options for being competitive,
                            and scripting your custom controller isn't enough sometimes and with certain game options.

                        <p>
                            A PC, a console, a network, a modem/router, a HDMI big screen, a big chair with big armrests, 
                            to be near from the screen, a Wiimote/Nunchuck, Bluetooth, or a custom controller with 
                            gyroscopes/accelerometers/magnetometers, are all needed to play comfortable and competitive. 
                            More simple and optimized is the software you using for emulating your custom controller to
                            simulate a controller or a keyboard and mouse, more you will enjoy playing because it will be
                            more responsive, and let in peace your PC. You can stop or remove useless programs and services.
                            It's better to use remote play for playing on console, instead of falling always against PC cheaters.
                            Console is more expensive if you play to a lot of games, but if you prefer multiplayer games and play
                            a lot at it, it's less expensive than a PC. You can use a cheap PC, and also a console is cheap, and to
                            setup so easy, and in the duration it's better. You don't need more than a portable PC or console
                            for travel with simple gaming. Even for going from kitchen to bed. Remember that Call of Duty are not
                            games, it's just pure hates for haters with only haters. Don't be too scary by PC users, if you want
                            playing games, but stay far from them. It's the worst community. They hacking, and insulting you
                            permanently. Never open any NAT/PAT rule on your modem/router for any of your device, even if someone or 
                            anything ask you to do it, or advice you. Disable UPNP instead, otherwise you will automatically
                            have these rules open by hacker programs. This world is own by jerks, just saying. The best experiences, are when 
                            you are far from multiplayer games, but also far from the possibility to be hacked. Cheaters can destroy your 
                            experiences even where there are no multiplayers in what you play. Choose the right side, and eventually integraly
                            and totaly. Find the right way. Don't hack, nor cheat, nor crack, it's for losers. Make your own experiments, but finish
                            by choosing your path. When trying to play on multiplayer games like Call of Duty, you can see after a few moment, cheaters
                            are pampered like big roies, they never need to rage quit, they are always in a team made to destroy your team, and every matches. 
                            A boss can be killed, a game can be achieved, while cheaters never die, so make them die in your games by rejecting any multiplayer.
                            Playing on console using remote play is working good with modem/router firewall settings in order to reduce packets send and receive
                            but it's worst than on PC in number of cheaters.

                        <p>
                            Sometimes control are bugged like with game options for aiming curves while you toggle aiming,
                            or even with the not fluidic aiming control when it's not set to linear. It'a also bugged with
                            the aiming, it toggle alone often. Trust your scripts, even if it can be considered as cheating,
                            beccause no one can tolerate these bugs while you want to play competitive in multiplayer games.
                            I've seen several games where the deadzone with curves isn't well handle when you want higher
                            sensitivity than default one, often when you are using a controller instead of a keyboard
                            and mouse. When you simulate it, you can turn faster and have a fine aim, better than with
                            native devices handle by the games. It can have limited control... Some games are well adapted 
                            with native devices, and it's hard to use a custom controller simulating a gamepad or keyboard 
                            and mouse. Don't be too scary if you can't find what control you want, it's just a game. Simple games
                            like 2D or 2.5D games are well adapted to play with any gamepad using native handle where it's meant to be
                            played. It's even more enjoyable when it's plug and play. But for competitive games like with a multiplayer
                            mode, it's hard to be disattached with the game and the control you want. By the what, it's not important
                            because there are too much tryhards, fools, cheaters, haters, bad guys, etc. Enjoy a portable console, enjoy
                            simple gameplay, games, puzzle, and so native control. The most important in video games is to enjoy what you playing,
                            the way, when it's simple, is not important, and you can't have a headache, setting it, because often,
                            you don't need a custom control, in most of games. You just need to choose the right games, those
                            you enjoy to play. Otherwise, choose your favorite multiplayer game and tweak your control settings until the end.
