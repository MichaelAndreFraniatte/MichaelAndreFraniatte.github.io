                        <p>
                            I created lots of really fun programs and works, and I want to be paid for it. I'm working
                            alone since 1999 everydays, 12 hours per day, on my own programs, for winning only insults
                            and screams.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will never understand what I made and said to people for I'm being considered as a
                            garbage. I'm unable to find and keep a job because it's such a big misery. I have no
                            friends. I hate to be judged and I hate mockery because most of people are just loving it
                            and are doing it all times. They taking life easy while cheating at school to get a good
                            job. They using their jobs just to compare themselves to each others, but they don't work in
                            reality. They are monkeys imitating other monkeys. They don't mind doing to me what they
                            don't want done to them. They look down on me, destroy me and destroy my work, they take my
                            work as if it was them who had done it, while they are unable of going further, of doing
                            better, of having done it themselves. They are narcissistic perverts, putting others down,
                            destroying each other, destroying the world and all life on Earth. They invent facts and
                            distort reality for their own benefit. They are spreading everywhere rumors that do not
                            exist. But, they boast themselves everywhere for trivial things, and they are very good at
                            lying, and at firing. They are also very good at making something very simple very
                            complicated. It would be better if they did nothing, rather than pretending, or doing
                            everything very badly. They take themselves too seriously with weird things too much often.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People are just like they are hating me. Thus, I prefer to work alone in my corner. Like
                            that, I don't lose time with metaphysical and behaviour issues, if someone would be against
                            my thoughts, avoiding me to make my advances, or if someone would want to scam me. Even if I
                            never be asked by someone to work with me, it's impossible to find someone, because no one
                            is enough honnest, and liking labours. But I've been asked to work for free. Just like
                            everytime because people with me are such like that everytime. They don't want I'm happy and
                            proud of me. They just put their names on my discoveries. They want all for free, and even
                            make me pay. They are big profiteers, and very selfish moreover. But they are just good to
                            insult me of what they are, and to accuse me of what they do. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            I made websites, blogs, books, videos, posts, supports and repositories, but people just came and went with my works without respecting my
                            copyrights. They never contacted me, never paid me, never shown any like, never watching my
                            videos, never subscribing, never following, even if I was delivering the best of anything.
                            I'm never quoted anywhere else, but I really did interesting discoveries, even like
                            deserving very big prices. What a shame! Even more I'm a victim since 1990 of abuse on my
                            mind with a brain implant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm really tired of being always stolen and discriminated. I'm also tired to have to work
                            alone for free while I'm ignored. Everything I found don't deserve to be lost and digested freely by shitheads. Who
                            is using anything from my works must pay me, which is completely normal. I never accepted
                            the abuse on my mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm owning the truth in lots of domains. There are no reasons for shitheads to insult me and
                            scream on me. I deserve to be respected and my copyrights also. I don't deserve to be stolen
                            and ignored like always in my life. My programs and works I'm selling deserve God bless, but
                            all the shitheads can go in hell, because they always trying to destroy me and my works.
                            Pure shame! Even if I was the first, in 2009, to find Origin of Life by synthetizing any
                            molecule at high pressure and high temperature, with experiments and making working Equation
                            of State with reaction model, I was fired from my University like a dog.

                        <p>
                            In 2009 I synthetized Acridine Orange at 250°C and 140 bar using my own Equation of State
                            model allowing to modelize any PVTX of fluids and reaction. I published only one article on
                            only stability of Adenine at 300°C and 500 bar because I've been fired from the laboratory I
                            was making my researches, like a dog, accused of stealing bottles of gas, stained autoclave,
                            gold, everything that were disapeared. I don't know why. Acridine Orange is the molecule of
                            Origin of Life in white smokers at Archean. It's a molecule that can replicate, making ADN.
                            It can increase lifetime, and bacteria are loving it. It make white sticks of sulfurs after
                            been digested. The laboratory I was, have broken an ESI-MS for I cannot have an analysis for
                            my second article. They also have broken a hydrogen line, for my third article. Since 2010,
                            I'm working on gaming controllers and audio listeners, mainly. Because the past is only
                            deserving who's owning the truth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How a researcher with a big reputation can affirm the equality of fugacities on both sides
                            of a membrane. Hydrogen diffusing through a membrane at 10 bar into 500 bar autoclave with
                            Argon make increase the pressure of Hydrogen with Argon to 13 bar for this researcher,
                            Hydrogen alone would be at only 10 bar and would be at 13 bar in autoclave, because for him
                            it's equality of fugacities. So for him the fugacity is 10 bar for Hydrogen in autoclave.
                            For my part, Argon increase to 503 bar because Argon have less space. I also calculate a
                            fugacity of Hydrogen far above 13 bar mixed with Argon, not the reverse. It's the equality
                            of pressure like I bring proof in my Thesis with a simple calculation. The fugacity of a gas
                            is the reactivity of a gas, and the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures from
                            molecular fractions, it's 513 bar from 10 bar of Hydrogen and 503 bar of Argon, nothing to
                            see with fugacities. Fugacities cannot be measured, fugacities can only be deduced from
                            calculation with Equation of State, and from reactions. This reputed researcher wanted to
                            refuse my Thesis, while I've calculated diffusion coefficients of every used membranes from
                            diffusion profiles in 2007. The day I was leaving the laboratory in 2011, this reputed
                            researcher was printing all my researches without my consent obviously. Like always I want
                            to say, but it's so noob, it did nothing more, while I had several articles under my hands,
                            but they never paid me, and I published nothing in science papers, even if I did everything
                            for it. From these times nothing changed.

                            Since, I have just the minimum social (like every social cases), and I'm
                            alone, with psychiatric hospital like a snot hanging from my nose. Do you beleve it? Have
                            you conscious of all the shitheads out there deciding for me and the doom of my own works?
                            Like me and my works need to disapear. Even if I think, everything I did were succesfull for
                            me. I can only count on myself for not my works would be lost.

                        <p>
                            It's always been the same story that keep repeating itself over and over again before and
                            after. Despite I'm only working, same kind of shitheads runining me and my works, trying
                            hard without working because lazzy and bad, just coming after the battles for crumbs, which
                            cannot be bought. It just stay having to copy/paste, but it's illegal. This what I figure
                            out I'm believing. Everywhere I worked, the Office suit would make clients very happy, instead
                            of all bad applications I was enrolled. With Excel, it's possible to connect SQL database and Arduino. 
                            With Word, it's possible to generate official signed documents. What else?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I brought works that would never be done because I have a certain sensibility and I work a lot. 
                            I know also deeply thinking. I was forced to publish my works without being paid, because it's 
                            important that my works don't have to be lost. To whome don't care to lose their works, it's because
                            their works are useless and reproductible easily, they just copy/paste what are found everywhere. 
                            There are researchers working under constrain, even if they get the chance to make advances in science,
                            they don't care to destroy others in their back or in front of them, like I've been destroyed, me and 
                            my works. They don't deserve their titles and status. They taking their chance only for having 
                            good times, but not for working obviously.

                            I've met too much shitheads, forced to notice that in a world of shitheads, only shitheads succeed. 
                            They are believing to be smart but they just do shit with low knowledge. They learn nothing but they 
                            are good at cheating, stealing, scaming, and at doing same shit as other shitheads like them. They 
                            just rolling their memory on what was teach to them, but they allow themselves to assert on everything 
                            they have none of knowledge. With all these shitheads, my works are definitively lost. Hence, I'm in 
                            right to publish my works for claim my copyrights in exchange of charge.
