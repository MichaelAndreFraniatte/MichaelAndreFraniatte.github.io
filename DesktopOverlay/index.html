                        <p>
                            I've been inspired by <a target="_blank" class="dl-link" href="https://www.rainmeter.net/">this</a>, 
                            but take care it modify your OS. You can close it with right click on the notify icon. 
                            You can also set the overlay to start automatically at your PC launch, or unset it, but you need to start the overlay 
                            with administrator privilege. You shall tweak the HTML file under assets folder from where is the program to add new audio files. 
                            Check my program named <a href="../rmomo/">rmomo</a> for tweak the HTML file with auto creation of audio tags in a file to copy/paste. 
                            You can also remove background picture from HTML file and add it for your desktop from display settings of Windows. 
                            But the last version run automatically with <a href="../STFU/">STFU</a>, you just need to copy/paste songs under assets or songs folder 
                            from where is located the program. Disable <a href="../EchoBoost/">EchoBoost</a> from params text file if you don't have a second audio card. 
                            From this file you can set the level of hearing for your second audio card like your laptop speakers. The first audio card corresponding to Bluetooth speakers. 
                            For using program, it need a key file for authenticate locally in order to be able to start properly, 
                            ask me to obtain this key file (it depend of your computer, not of the program).
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            Keyboard key Escape is used to close the program. F1 is used to open about (?). Previous, Next and Pause tracks are used to normal binding, 
                            but a long press for Previous and Next skip the current track to a new random track.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Xbox controller button A is used to skip the current track to a new random track. B is used to return to previous tracks already listen. X and Y 
                            are used for Play/Pause current track. Left and Right Shoulders are used to go to previous and next track. Left and Right Triggers are used 
                            to go to previous and next artist. Start and Back are used for fast forward and fast backward current track. Left, Rigth, Up and Down are used
                            to set previous, next, random and loop playing. It don't need to have the program in background, while keyboard binding need the program to be 
                            in background.

                            The following video demonstrate the features of my program. The video is a bit laggy because of my cheap laptop PC, 
                            unable to record properly, but in reality audio visualization is very smooth and well synchronized with audio.
