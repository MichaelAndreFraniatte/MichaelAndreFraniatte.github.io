                            Only Youtubers can choose to play everywhere having all consoles and a good PC. Nobody have all their times and money for playing.
                            The big issue with consoles is having only certain games dedicated for each manufacturer while it's not retrocompatible for most
                            of games, but you take pleasure by playing your new games. The PC is having more choose in applications and games not very expensive.
                            Both constrain you to rebuy a new console or PC every 5 to 10 years. Let's see...

                            Consoles and PC have lot of cheaters for both. The PC can have competitive gameplay with custom controllers, but also consoles
                            with its controllers when having Gyro. You can use firewall on PC but it's not enough because hackers are attacking easy your PC,
                            it's a mess. When you use firewall on consoles it's far better even with crossplatform enable.

                            A PC let you choose to use a custom controller with programs, and there are plenty of programs with ease access. There are a lot
                            of games, AAA games and indie games very fun, more than on consoles. You can also use your PC for remote play and cloud gaming, but it's
                            not good as playing directly on PC.

                        <p>
                            The social on a PC is horrible. Stay with anything private on a PC. Be far from the community. A PC or a console are not equal for social
                            networking. You can be easy insulted by anyone you don't know on PC, and you can't totally shut down them. They harrass you and hacking your PC.

                        <p>
                            There are good gyro third party controllers for motion gaming on consoles. For the PC you can also use it. It's compatible. Stay far from programs handling controllers.
                            Xbox or Playstation or Nintendo will never be buy by Apple. Don't buy CD keys on grey market for playing horrible games but screaming games become horrible.
                            Don't trust Youtubers because they more talk than doing anything good. PC stay annoying with lot of issues. A console can be more ease of access for playing without horrible
                            launchers in stacks like on PC.
